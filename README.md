# Detection-of-Network-Abnormalities-Summer-RAID-23
Utilizing Network Abnormalities to detect DDoS attacks, an implementation of an academic paper from Princeton under RAID  
Title: Machine Learning DDoS Detection for Consumer Internet of Things Devices  
Research Paper Reference: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8424629  
Phase 1:  
-> Extraction of relevant features amongst the headers of network packets  
-> Determine best model amongst those suggested from research by implementation.  
Phase 2:  
-> Develop our own dataset after the physical implemetation using Raspberry Pi.  
-> Creation of a model that can identify malicious packets across different networks, for eg in bluetooth enabled devices
